## Theme Features

* ⚖️ Introducing top-bar fusion, striking a balance between aesthetics and efficiency.

    * 📌 All blank areas of the top bar can be used to drag the window (except for the gap between tabs)
    * 📌 If top bar icons or dividers appear misaligned or overlapped, resizing the edit area or app window may fix it.
    * 📌 The code for pinning the top bar in previous versions is no longer effective and can be manually deleted.
* 🚥 Position of traffic lights on macOS adjusted, optimizing the layout rhythm.

  * 📌 You will need to restart the application after switching to another theme to restore the traffic light to its default position.
* ↕️ Applied system scrollbar on macOS, which can be hidden automatically and reduce visual interference.
* ➖ Dividing lines simplified, creating a consistent and organized layout style.
* 🧩 Optimized the inner and outer spacing of super blocks, making it easy to achieve grid and masonry layouts and create an elegant doc page.
* 📐 Extra spacing between layout blocks removed, expanding overall display range.
* 🔛 Adaptive layout implemented, maximizing screen space utilization.
* 🌓 Light and dark modes supported.
* 🗂️ File tree and outline indent guides added.
* 🔍 Search list and backlink list display optimized.
* ⚙️ Styles of iFrame, videos, images, and other controls redesigned.
